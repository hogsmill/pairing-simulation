# pairing-simulation

An app to explore how knowledge sharing through pairing influences speed and
quality of software development.

## Strategies

1. **No Pairing** this is the control group. We hope to show that this is a bad strategy :-)
1. **Best Pairing** put the 2 team members with the best knowledge on every task
1. **Best Sharing** put the most expert, and the least expert on every task
1. **Worst Pairing** put the 2 least expert team members on each task
1, **Random** randomly assign team members to each task

Additionally, every pairing strategy can **swap** or not after each cycle to further spread the knowledge.

## How it works
