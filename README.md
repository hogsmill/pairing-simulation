# pairing-simulation

An app to explore how knowledge sharing through pairing influences speed and
quality of software development.

## Strategies

1. **No Pairing** this is the control group. We hope to show that this is a bad strategy :-)
1. **Best Pairing** put the 2 team members with the best knowledge on every task
1. **Best Sharing** put the most expert, and the least expert on every task
1. **Worst Pairing** put the 2 least expert team members on each task
1. **Random** randomly assign team members to each task

Additionally, every pairing strategy can **swap** one of the pair - or not - after
each cycle to further spread the knowledge. As with pairing, there are a number of
strategies:

1. **Swap Weakest** change the pair with the least expertise for the task
1. **Swap Strongest** change the pair with most expertise
1. **Random** randomly swap somebody off the task

(Swapping not yet implemented)

## How it works
